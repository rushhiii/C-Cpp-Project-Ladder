# 🚀 Learn C/C++ by Building – Project Ladder

Welcome! This repository is a collection of **practical C/C++ projects** arranged from **beginner to advanced** level.

Each project is designed to **teach you real concepts** in C/C++ through hands-on coding — so you build your skills **while building something useful** you can proudly showcase.


## 🟢 Level 1 – Beginner Projects
Perfect for learning syntax, loops, conditionals, and functions.

### ✅ 1. Unit Converter CLI
Convert between units like km ↔ miles, °C ↔ °F, INR ↔ USD, etc.
- Learn: `if/else`, `switch`, arithmetic, functions

### 🎲 2. Number Guessing Game
Guess a random number between 1–100.
- Learn: `rand()`, loops, `scanf`, conditionals

### 📅 3. Age Calculator
Input your birthdate, output your exact age.
- Learn: `<time.h>`, struct, date math


## 🟡 Level 2 – Intermediate Projects
Dive into file I/O, modularization, and structured data.

### 📝 4. To-Do List Manager (CLI)
Create, view, delete tasks saved to a file.
